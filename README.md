# Udacity_project_1

The aim of this analysis was to understand Airbnb costs in Boston and Seattle, and how these were linked to location reviews

# Files:
Python code which details library imports, data manipulation and tidying, analysis and a model build to predict the price of Airbnb rooms in each city. 

# Libraries required 
•	Pandas

• Numpy

•	Matplotlib

•	Seaborn

•	Sklearn


# Data required
This project uses data from the below two sources.

https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston

As both datasets contain the same three files (listings, reviews, calendar) save these in their own files within the working directory called “boston” and “seattle”, and ensure these are saved as CSVs. For example the first file the code imports is at “seattle/calendar.csv”.

# Results
The findings can be found in this blog post:
